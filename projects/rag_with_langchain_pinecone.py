rag_with_langchain_pinecone.py

A simple LangChain demo that retrieves relevant documents from a vector store (Pinecone)
and uses them to augment responses from a language model (LLM). This demonstrates
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using Pinecone and OpenAI's embeddings.

Concepts:
RAG, chain of thought, conversational flow, document retrieval, interactive session,
model augmentation, semantic search, vectorization

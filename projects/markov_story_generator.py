"""
markov_story_generator.py

A step-by-step story generator that builds one sentence at a time,
mimicking a Markov Chain-like process. Each new step builds upon the
previous, demonstrating short-term memory and incremental narrative flow.

Concepts: Markov Chain, chain of thought, conversation history, short-term memory, turn-based dialogue
